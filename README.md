# RISEMASTER Frontend

**RISEMASTER** is an AI-powered adaptive mathematics learning platform for Rwandan secondary school students (S1–S6). It uses real REB national examination past papers, step-by-step guidance, teen-friendly concept introductions, multi-level hints, and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to track and celebrate individual learning progress (growth mindset over final scores).

This repository contains the **frontend web application** built with React, Tailwind CSS, and modern best practices.
